			<p>"Saundra prepared and led an incredible art workshop for our Admin Office EA team. She thoughtfully set an intention that resonated deeply with the team. We are greatly appreciative that she took the time to meet with us. The team has struggled with burnout, and they had nothing but resoundingly positive feedback and want another session. Saundra was able to accommodate the unusual needs of the team members who had to come in & out during the session. She perfectly connected theory with practice. Thank you, Saundra, for going above and beyond to support our EA team!"</p>

			<p>"The creative workshop was such a nice break from my usual routine. I felt relaxed, free, and completely stress-free the whole time. Using improvisation to lift our mood was honestly so fun—it let me express myself without overthinking and just enjoy the moment. I left feeling calm, happy, and recharged."</p>

			<p>"After the NJPAC workshop, I was truly amazed at how relaxed and comfortable I felt. Despite doing this workshop with people I didn't really know, Sophia was able to create a welcoming and comforting space that allowed me to let loose a lot which was helpful because of the consistent rush that I am often in. This workshop did an amazing job in helping me reset my thoughts, mind, and body. This honestly made me more interested and immersed into the process of how art helps us mentally. Thank you for this opportunity!"</p>
